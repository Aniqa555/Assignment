They help define the structure and flow of a program, allowing you to perform essential tasks like making decisions (if, else), looping (for, while), defining functions (def), and managing exceptions (try, except). Because these keywords are reserved, you can’t use them as variable names or identifiers. They act as the building blocks of Python’s syntax, making code easier to understand and ensuring that Python’s rules and structure are followed."

Ex- include integers, strings, and tuples. For eg- if you have my_string = \"hello\", trying to change a character (like my_string[0] = \"H\") will result in an error. It will remains unchanged."

        "#ans- Python has several types of operators that perform different functions in expressions. Arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and / are used for basic math; for example, 5 + 3 results in 8. Comparison operators such as ==, !=, >, and < help compare values, returning True or False (e.g., 5 > 3 is True). Logical operators (and, or, not) combine conditional statements, like (5 > 3) and (3 < 4), which is True. Assignment operators (=, +=, -=) assign values to variables, so x += 5 adds 5 to x. Bitwise operators ( &, |) work at the binary level for tasks like bit manipulation, while membership (in, not in) and identity operators (is, is not) check for membership in collections and object identity, respectively. These operators make Python versatile for performing a wide range of operations within code."

        "#Ans- Type casting in Python is converting one data type to another. There are two main ways to cast types in Python explicit and implicit. Explicit Casting: You manually convert types using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc. eg- to convert a string to an integer, int(\"5\") becomes 5. Similarly, float(10) converts the integer 10 to 10.0. Implicit Casting: Python automatically converts types when it’s safe to do so. For eg- if you add an integer and a float (5 + 2.0), Python will convert 5 to 5.0 automatically, giving 7.0 as the result."
